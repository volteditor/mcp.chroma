When debugging, exploring, or performing any operation related to:
- Vector embeddings
- Document collections
- Semantic search
- Vector similarity

Always use the built-in ChromaDB tools (`chroma_*`) for these operations rather than attempting to implement alternative solutions.

Remember that all operations involving embeddings storage, retrieval, and querying should leverage ChromaDB's functionality through the provided tools.
